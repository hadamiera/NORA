# Justification Planning
## Case Studies
Artist : Pipilotti Rist
Artwork : Pixel Forest and Worry Will Vanish
Visitors are invited to experience these two works of art in two different ways. For Pixel Forest, take a stroll through the installation, which the artist describes as “a digital image that has exploded in space.” As you watch Worry Will Vanish, recline on pillows and relax, losing yourself in Rist’s universe.

## Background Research
Appreciating life is something that everyone should have gratitude about. Some people cherish each new day, notice acts of kindness, acknowledge the sacrifices of others and be thankful for every privilege or positive aspects of their lives (Adler & Fagley, 2005). 

There are a lot of way to understand a significance other and to let each individual constructs their own motivation, hope, optimism and their emotional intelligence. Some research has been conducted on the concept of gratitude (e.g., Barker, 1995; Dickson, 1996; Emmons & Crumpler, 2000; Peterson, 1987), 

Appreciation is acknowledge the value and meaning of something, an event, a behavior, a person, or an object. It’s the positive feeling emotional connection to it. The experience of appreciation creates the feeling of gratitude and enhance positive mood or feelings that we feel connected to

### Interaction Flow
There are two dual sided screen. The video will be projected on each screens. 1 screen will project a video of Prosperous live, and the other is Indigent. The PIR sensor will detect a person for the video to start playing. The audience then experience a different perspective of two lives. The audience then can proceed to the appreciation hanging wall after watching the video to write their feedback on what they appreciate about in life.

### Interaction Flow

The video will be projected on the curve screen. The screen will be playing a trailer of a video and when a person is in front of the screen, it will change to a question that they can choose. They have to interact(hand gesture) with the screen to start watching the video and feel the experience of another perspective life. The kinect will detect where they will click on the screen. When the video is over, they will have a choice to write whatever they feel on a piece of paper and stick it on the wall under the UV light.

### Interaction Flow

The video are projected on the fog to give an effect of Hologram. The sensor will detect a person for the video to start playing. The video will play 2 different lives next to each other on the fog. The audience can experience it through a fog hologram.
